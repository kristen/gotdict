title: Robert Arryn
---

Robert Arryn is the only son of Jon Arryn and his wife, Lysa Tully. He is a sickly, whiny, irritating, and desperately spoilt child of six, now Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale. He was named after Robert Baratheon.

He is small and pale with brown hair and big eyes. Robert is afflicted with a disease that causes frequent seizures. His maester bleeds him frequently and often administers a painkiller during his fits that, if used continuously, has an increasing level of toxicity. He is intellectually and physically stunted, and is not even weaned from his mother's breast. He is called "Sweetrobin".
