Prince Garin, better known as Garin the Great, is a historical figure of the Rhoynar.

Prince Garin led 250, 000 men to their deaths in an attempt to stop the Valyrians. He was named Garin the Great for giving the Valyrians pause. According to legend, the men of Volantis and Valyria hung Garin in a golden cage and mocked him as he called upon Mother Rhoyne to destroy them. That very night the waters rose and drowned the invaders of Chroyane. From that they, the spirits of the fallen conquerors remained beneath the waters, and their breath rises from the murk to make the fogs that infest the ruined city. It is also belived by some that Garin rose from his watery grave and became the Shrouded Lord.
