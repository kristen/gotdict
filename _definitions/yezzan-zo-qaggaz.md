Yezzan zo Qaggaz is an extremely wealthy slave trader and is one of the Wise Masters from Yunkai. He is said to be the richest man in Yunkai and has great influence because of this.

He has yellow eyes and is so morbidly obese he can no longer stand. He is sickly and cannot hold his water so always smells of piss that even perfume cannot hide. He wears Yellow silk tokars with gold fringe. He is obsessed with grotesques and often purchases slaves with physical deformities to add to his "collection". His most favored slave of his collection is Sweets. While overweight he is still shrewd and intelligent, a trait some of the other Wise Masters dont share.
