title: Rodrik Stark
---

King Rodrik Stark was King in the North and head of House Stark. His statue is in the crypts of Winterfell, near that of Torrhen Stark. King Rodrik won Bear Island from the Ironborn in a wrestling match and awarded it to House Mormont. As the Ironborn dynasty House Hoare previously held possession of Bear Island king Rodrik must have lived at sometime during their rule (4000 before AL - 1 AL).
