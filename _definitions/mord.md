title: Mord
---

Mord is a gaoler of House Arryn, in charge of the upkeep and maintenance of the sky cells of the Eyrie.

Mord is a large man, slow-witted brute, who's fond of tormenting the prisoners, telling them how they are going to fall out of the cells to their deaths. He has small, dark eyes, rotting brown teeth and the left side of his face has a scar from where an axe cut off his ear and part of his cheek. He has a large belly and thick, stubby-fingered hands.
