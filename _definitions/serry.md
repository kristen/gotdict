House Serry of Southshield rules over the southernmost of the Shield Islands. The shield islands are a considerable sea strength and were the first line of defense during the days when the ironborn raiders tried to sail up the Mander to sack the wealth of the Reach. Their blazon is a white rose upon a red escutcheon upon white, a red embattled border.

The known members of this house are:

Lord Osbert Serry, Lord of Southshield

Ser Talbert Serry, His son. Heir to Southshield.

Lia Serry, married into a secondary branch of House Tyrell.
