Davos Seaworth, commonly called the Onion Knight, was once a smuggler, but after Robert's Rebellion became a landed knight and Stannis Baratheon's most honest and loyal supporter. He captains the Black Betha, his old smuggling ship. He has seven sons, many of them serving on ships in Stannis's fleet. His wife tends his lands on Cape Wrath. Davos created his own house sigil, a black ship with an onion on the sails upon a grey field. Davos is a slight man with an ordinary face. He has brown hair and eyes, and a beard peppered with gray. The first joints of the fingers of his left hand are missing. He wears the bones in a pouch around his neck.
