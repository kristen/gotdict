title: Coldhands
---

Coldhands is a mysterious figure from beyond the Wall. He looks like a wight dressed in the black of the Night's Watch with a scarf concealing his face, a corpse with hands black from pooled and congealed blood, but is intelligent and seemingly benign. His hands are black and as cold as ice, and he rides a great elk. A flock of ravens flies under his command.
