House Darklyn of Duskendale is an extinct house that ruled for centuries the town of Duskendale and the surrounding lands. Their keep was the Dun Fort, at the top of the hill that dominates the town.

The Darklyns had been petty kings during the Age of Heroes, and their power reached as far as the Crackclaw Point. Later their realm was swallowed by the surrounding larger kingdoms, but the Darklyns remained and served their new kings as the proud Lords of Duskendale.

Their closest allies were their bannermen of House Hollard, who served them loyally and even provided brides three times for the Darklyn kings of old.

During the Targaryen rule, they were close allies to the dragonlords to the point that seven sons of Darklyn had joined the Kingsguard, more than any other house, a fact which is referred to in the Darklyns' coat of arms. Those good terms with the Iron Throne ended with the Defiance of Duskendale.
