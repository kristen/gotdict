terms:
  - Company of the Cat
---

A mercenary company of three thousand infantry found in the Free Cities. They are led by a captain known as Bloodbeard.

There is enmity between the Company of the Cat and the Windblown. A year previous in the Disputed Lands they had been on opposite sides of the battle lines and bad blood still lingers. Bloodbeard makes no secret of his disdain for the Tattered Prince whom he refers to as old grey-beards in rags.
