Seagard is a town and castle in the Riverlands. It is the seat of House Mallister. Located on the western coast of the Riverlands, Seagard is sheltered by the Cape of Eagles and nestled near the headwaters of the Blue Fork.

Seagard was built to defend the coast from Ironborn reavers.

The Booming Tower in the town is named for the immense bronze bell, used to call the townsfolk and others into the safety of the castle when longships were sighted.

During the Greyjoy Rebellion, the bronze bell of the Booming Tower was rang for the first time in three hundred years, when longships under the command of Rodrik Greyjoy attacked Seagard. Lord Jason Mallister killed Rodrik beneath the castle walls and threw the ironmen back into the sea.
