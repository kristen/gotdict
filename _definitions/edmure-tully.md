Edmure Tully is the head of House Tully. He is Lord Paramount of the Riverlands and Lord of Riverrun. He has red-brown hair, like most Tullys, and grew a fierce beard. He is of medium height. Edmure Tully was born as the third child and only living son of Hoster Tully and Minisa Whent. His mother died when he was very young. As a youth, he was known as hot-headed but good-hearted. He had a number of friends who had similar characteristics. He often went wenching and had a number of affairs. In one case, he had drunk too much and was unable to "perform". A singer, Tom of Sevens, made a mocking song about Edmure, which mentioned a "floppy fish", causing him to develop a dislike of singers in general.
