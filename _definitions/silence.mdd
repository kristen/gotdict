title: Silence
---

The Silence is the warship captained by Euron Greyjoy. It is red, lean and fearsome. It has a single mast. It has black sails, dark red hull and it is infamous. Its decks are painted red to better hide the blood that soaked them. On the prow is a black iron maiden with long legs, slender waist, high breasts and mother-of-pearl eyes but no mouth. It is crewed by mutes.
