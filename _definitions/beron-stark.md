title: Beron Stark

Lord Beron Stark was the head of House Stark. He ruled the North during the reign of Aerys I.

Lord Beron was gathering swords to throw Dagon Greyjoy's ironmen back into the sea and made common cause with the Lord of Casterly Rock for it. Due to the timeline of events it is possible that Beron was a brother of Willam Stark and Artos Stark thus he could have been the father of Edwyle Stark.
