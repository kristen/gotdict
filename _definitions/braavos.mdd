title: Braavos
---

Unique among the Free Cities, Braavos was not a Valyrian colony, but a secret refuge from Valyrian expansion. A seafaring city of tiny islands, Braavos is known for its swashbuckling bravos and its Guild of the Faceless Men. It is also famed for the Titan of Braavos, both a fortress and a statue.
