Ser Aenys Frey is the third son of Lord Walder Frey and his first spouse, Lady Perra Royce. He is married to Tyana Wylde, who died giving birth. He is a tall man, but grey and round-shouldered, with big watery, red eyes, and gnarled hands. He is said to have hungry eyes, close-set above a pointed nose. He has a thin beard, that does not conceal his weak chin. Aenys has a bald head. He is a seasoned soldier but is regarded as a commander not a swordsman, he is cruel and clever.
