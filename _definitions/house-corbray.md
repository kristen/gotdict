House Corbray of Heart's Home is one of the main noble houses from the Vale. It is an old but poor house. The ancestral Valyrian sword of House Corbray is called Lady Forlorn.

They blazon their arms with three black ravens in flight holding three red hearts, on white.

The known members of this house are:

Lord Lyonel Corbray, the Lord of Heart's Home. A childless man of forty-odd years.

Ser Lyn Corbray, his eldest brother and heir. A quarrelsome knight.

Ser Lucas Corbray, his brother.
