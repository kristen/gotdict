title: Victarion Greyjoy
---

Victarion Greyjoy is a brother of Balon Greyjoy and Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet, his flagship is Iron Victory. He is a capable commander and a fierce warrior in battle, but has a calm demeanor outside of it, thinking of enemies with great respect. He is a religious man and wears full plate armor while sailing because he has no fear of drowning. Victarion recognized the greatness of his older brother Balon and followed him loyally.

He commanded the Iron Fleet during the Greyjoy Rebellion. During the rebellion, using a plan Euron had concocted, they sailed into Lannisport and burned the Lannister fleet at anchor. His fleet was smashed by Stannis in a trap at Fair Isle and his younger brother Aeron's vessel, the Golden Storm, was chopped in half by the warship Fury. After the rebellion's end, he continued to serve as Lord Captain faithfully. His brother, Euron, seduced and impregnated his third wife, which drove Victarion to beat her to death to retain his honor. Only the taboo against kinslaying kept Victarion from killing Euron. He has not married since, nor has he forgiven Euron.
