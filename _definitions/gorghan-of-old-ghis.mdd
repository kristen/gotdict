Gorghan, better known as Gorghan of Old Ghis, is an ancient scholar. History: Gorghan once wrote that a "prophecy is like a treacherous woman. She takes your member in her mouth, and you moan with the pleasure and thin, how sweet, how fine, how good it is...and then her teeth snap shut and your moans turn to screams. That is the nature of prophecy."
