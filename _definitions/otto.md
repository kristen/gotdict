title: Otto

Ser Otto Hightower was considered a man of great learning in his time. Ser Otto was famous for his knowledge. For this ability, he was named Hand of the King and was a disaster.

He is now a warning to future Hands that knowledge is not everything. As Viserys I Targaryen was married to a woman of House Hightower it is possible that Otto was either the hand for him, succeeding Lyonel Strong, or his son of that marriage Aegon II Targaryen
