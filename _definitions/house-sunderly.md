House Sunderly of Saltcliffe is one of the nobles houses from the Iron Islands. Their seat is located on the island of Saltcliffe. They blazon their arms with a drowned man, pink and pale, floating upright in a blue-green sea, his hair streaming upwards, as fish nibble at his limbs.

There are no known members.
