Maggy, better known as Maggy the Frog was a woodswitch from Lannisport. Her true name has been forgotten, while "Maggy" was likely a bastardization of the word "Maegi". Maggy came to Lannisport as a young woman, brought by her husband who had been trading spices in the East. Their son was the founder of House Spicer.
