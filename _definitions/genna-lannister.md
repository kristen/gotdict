title: Genna Lannister
---

Lady Genna Lannister is the daughter of Tytos Lannister. She was made to marry Emmon Frey and has four children with him, or so she claims they are his, no one in Casterly Rock had the courage to ever suggest otherwise, least of all her husband.

Genna is the aunt of Cersei, Jaime and Tyrion and took on a maternal role to them after Joanna Lannister's death. She is also one of the few Lannisters who recognized Tyrion's talent for political maneuvering.

In her youth Genna was shapely, later she is described as fat, square with a broad and smooth face. Intelligent and shrewd, Genna bosses around her husband whom she considers inept, an assessment that Jaime shares.
