title: Ten Towers
---

Ten Towers is the seat of House Harlaw. It is the newest castle in the Iron Islands. It is more like ten castles smashed together. The castle was built by Lord Theomore Harlaw. He raised the castle after he found the ancient seat of House Harlaw, Harlaw Hall too damp and flooded after losing three sons. There is good fishing off the Long Stone Quay.
