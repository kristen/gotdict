Lord Garlan Tyrell, better known as Garlan the Gallant, is the second son of Lord Mace Tyrell and Lady Alerie Hightower. His personal coat of arms is two golden roses on green, to denote his status as second son.

Garlan is similar in appearance to his brother Ser Loras Tyrell, but he is taller, more broadly built and has a beard. He is five years older than Ser Loras.

He is an exceptionally skilled swordsman, preferring to train against three or four swordsmen, so as to better prepare himself for actual battle, but his lack of interest in gaining glory makes him less famous than his younger brother, Ser Loras.
