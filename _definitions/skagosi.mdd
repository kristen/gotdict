title: Skagosi
---

The people of Skagos call themselves Skagosi, which means "Stoneborn" in the Old Tongue. Other Northmen derisively call them "Skaggs." Descendents of the First Men, Skagosi are savage, little more than tribes of raiders who are thought to be cannibals.

It's said that in ancient days, men of Skagos sailed to Skane, seizing all the women, killing all the men, and feasting on their hearts and livers for a fortnight. (Skane has been uninhabited since).
