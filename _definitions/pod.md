Podrick Payne is the squire of Tyrion Lannister. He is from a cadet branch of House Payne. He is a very quiet boy. He is twelve years old.

Podrick was born a member of a lesser branch of House Payne. His father was a squire to richer cousins and his mother was a chandler's daughter. His father died in the Greyjoy Rebellion and his mother abandoned him when he was four years old.

He ended up with Ser Cedric Payne who took care of him. Ser Cedric died while fighting in the Riverlands for Lord Tywin Lannister. Pod, alone in the army, had attached himself to the hedge knight Ser Lorimer who was part of Lord Leo Lefford's baggage train. Ser Lorimer stole a ham and was hanged for it but Podrick, who had shared the ham, was spared due to his family's name. He was then given over to Tyrion Lannister to be his squire.
