Prince Aerion Targaryen was the second son of Maekar I, also known as Aerion the Monstrous or Aerion Brightflame as he liked to call himself. He is one of the most outstanding examples of the latent folly than can hit the members of House Targaryen. Cruel and arrogant, he thought he was a dragon in human form.
