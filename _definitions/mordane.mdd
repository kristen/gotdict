---

Septa Mordane is the Septa at Winterfell. She serves as tutor to the Stark girls, Sansa and Arya.

Her primary duties involve teaching the two girls the gentle arts and turning them into noblewomen. She finds Sansa to be a delightful student, but is often exasperated with Arya's antics and rebellion.

She has a bony face and sharp eyes. She has a thin, lipless mouth. She starched her skirts. While strict she is a good woman who cares about both Sansa and Arya.
