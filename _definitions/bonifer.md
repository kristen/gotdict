Ser Bonifer Hasty, also known as Bonifer the Good, is an old knight from the Stormlands. He is tall, thin and known for his piety; he leads the Holy Hundred. He is a friend of Lord Orton Merryweather. In his youth, Ser Bonifer was a promising knight in tourneys, but when the love of his life married someone else, he turned away from seeking glory to devote himself to the Faith of the Seven. He is a withered, solemn stork of a man, with a stern, sad face, who is prone to salting his speech with appeals to the Seven.
