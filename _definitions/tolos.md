title: Tolos
---

Tolos is a city that lies on the northwest coast of Slaver's Bay. It is a port city. It is connected by Valyrian roads to Mantarys and Bhorash. To the west lies the city of Elyria on its island. The Black Cliffs lie between it and Bhorash.

Tolosi slingers are the best slingers in the world, and they throw soft lead balls in place of stones. Tyrion notes that their lead balls do vastly more damage than the smooth stones other slingers use, and more than any bow as well. Hizdahr has kin in Tolos.

The city has been plagued by a high incidence of the bloody flux circa 300-301 AL.
