title: Baelor Targaryen

Baelor Targaryen, known as Baelor Breakspear, was the eldest son of King Daeron II Targaryen and Myriah Martell. He was named after King Baelor I. From 194 to 209 AL, Prince Baelor served as his father's Hand. Prince Baelor had the dark hair of his mother, a Dornish princess. He kept it cut short and kept his jaw clean-shaven. His nose had been broken twice.

When the Blackfyre Rebellion was in its early stages, Prince Baelor advocated leniency toward Daemon Blackfyre, a position that was not favored over his uncle Bloodraven's hard line. Nonetheless, Baelor accepted the path towards war. He distinguished himself by leading the Dornish-Stormlands force which attacked the rearguard of the rebel army during the Battle of the Redgrass Field, smashing them against the shield-wall of his brother Prince Maekar and inspiring the song The Hammer and Anvil. After the battle, he was named Hand of the King by his father and was recognized as a good Hand and "the soul of chivalry." At some point he was also given the title of Protector of the Realm.
