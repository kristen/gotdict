The Wolfswood is a large forest found in the North made up oak, evergreen and black brier. It is called the Wolfswood for the great many wolves one can hear howling in the night. It stretches across the northwest part of the North.

Even in the deepest parts of the Wolfswood, there are crofters, foresters and hunters.. Deepwood Motte, the wooden fastness of House Glover, sits on a hill within the forest near the Bay of Ice. Families sworn to Deepwood Motte include the Forresters, Woodses, Branches, and Boles, all of whom are skilled woodsmen.
