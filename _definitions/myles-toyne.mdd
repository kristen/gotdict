title: Myles Toyne

Myles Toyne, also known as Blackheart, is a descendent of House Toyne and was a former captain of the Golden Company. Upon his death he is replaced as captain by Harry Strickland.

Myles Toyne was not dark and handsome like his infamous forebear Terrence Toyne, Myles was jug eared, with a big nose and a crooked jaw.

Myles Toyne is descendent from Ser Terrence Toyne, the Kingsguard knight who was caught abed with one of King Aegon IV mistresses. Toyne was known as "Blackheart" because of the sigil on his shield. Myles enjoyed the nickname and what it implied, as a captain should be feared by friends and foes alike, if people thought him cruel so much the better. Toyne however was not cruel, a soldier to the bone he was firm but fair. After his death his skull was dipped in gold and placed upon a company standard.
