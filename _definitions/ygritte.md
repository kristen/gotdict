Ygritte is a wildling woman and spearwife. Ygritte is nineteen, and described as short for her age, skinny but well-muscled, with a round face, small hands, a pug nose, and crooked white teeth. Her most distinctive feature was her fiery red hair. The wildlings consider red hair to be lucky and describe those with it as having been "kissed by fire."
