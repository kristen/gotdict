 House Chester of Greenshield rules over one of the Shield Islands. The Shield Islands are a considerable sea strength and were the first line of defense during the days that the Ironborn pirates tried to sail up the Mander to sack the wealth of the Reach. They blazon their arms with a green hand on a gold escutcheon on a green field, a border of red rayonne.

The known members of this house are:

Lord Moribald Chester, Lord of Greenshield.
