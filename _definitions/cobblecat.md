The Cobblecat is a trading galley. It was once captained by Roro Uhoris. Ser Davos Seaworth served as a cabin boy aboard it.

Roro took the Cobblecat north of the Wall and traded weapons and goods to the wildlings for furs and other precious goods. When he set sail south again, he was intercepted by three ships of the Night's Watch out of Eastwatch-by-the-sea. The Cobblecat was brought into port and Roro was executed for having traded arms to the wildlings.
