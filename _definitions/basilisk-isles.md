title: Basilisk Isles
---

The Basilisk Isles are a group of islands off the northern coast of Sothoros. To the south lies Zamettar, to the east Ax Isle and to the southwest, the Isle of Toads.

The mud-and-blood towns of the Basilisk Isles team with escaped slaves, slavers, skinners, whores, hunters, brindled men, and worse. There are always provisions to be had there for men who are not afraid to pay the iron price.
