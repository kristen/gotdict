---

Hodor is a stableboy serving at Winterfell. His real name is Walder. Hodor is large and slow of wits, but is gentle and loyal to the Stark family. He is only capable of saying one word, Hodor. The Stark children believed this to be his name, until enlightened by Old Nan, his great-grandmother, that his real name was in fact Walder. Hodor is over seven feet tall, he has brown eyes and a brown beard. It's been suggested by Osha that his large size is a result of giants blood.
