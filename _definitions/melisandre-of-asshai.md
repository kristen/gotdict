Melisandre is a priestess of R'hllor and a Shadowbinder, hailing from the eastern city of Asshai. She has joined the entourage of Stannis Baratheon, believing him to be Azor Ahai reborn, a hero destined to defeat the Great Other. She has become an influential advisor to him and his family.

Melisandre is a great beauty, with long hair the color of burnished copper and pale, unblemished skin. She is slender and graceful, and taller than most knights. She has full breasts, a narrow waist, and a heart-shaped face . Her voice is sonorous, with an exotic accent.

As is the custom of the Red priests of her faith, she wears red or crimson clothing, usually long gowns of silk. She is never without the red gold choker that fits snuggly around her neck. When she works magic, the ruby setting glows with power. It can burn her if the magic worked is particularly demanding.
