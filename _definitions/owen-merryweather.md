Lord Owen Merryweather was Hand of the King to Aerys II.

He replaced Lord Tywin Lannister as Hand of the King. He was an old man at the time, considered amiable but not capable. He proved ineffectual in preventing the uprising that came to be known as Robert's Rebellion. He was stripped of lands and titles and exiled for his failure. He was replaced as Hand of the King by Lord Jon Connington.
