Ser Arthur Dayne, known as the Sword of the Morning, was a famed and legendary knight and a member of Aerys II's Kingsguard. He was Prince Rhaegar's closest friend. His accomplishments include defeating the Kingswood Brotherhood. He got the smallfolk to love him by paying for what he and his forces took and taking their grievances before King Aerys II. In the end he slayed the Smiling Knight in single combat and ended the threat of the Brotherhood. Following that victory, he knighted Jaime Lannister, who would later become a sworn brother of the Kingsguard.

He broke twelve lances against Prince Rhaegar Targaryen in a tourney held at Storm's End, losing to the prince. At the Tourney at Harrenhal, he was defeated by Prince Rhaegar once again.

He wielded the greatsword called Dawn as part of his office as Sword of the Morning, carrying it slung across his back. He died at the Tower of Joy fighting Eddard Stark and his companions, but the exact circumstances of his death are unclear.

In a memory of his father, Bran Stark recalls his father describing Arthur Dayne as the finest knight he ever saw, and elaborates further that Dayne would have killed him if not for Howland Reed. Dayne is remembered as not only a skilled fighter but a valiant and true knight. Eddard Stark, Jaime Lannister and Barristan Selmy all recall or remember Dayne with nothing less than absolute respect for both the man and his legend.
