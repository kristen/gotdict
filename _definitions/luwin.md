title: Luwin
---

Maester Luwin is a maester in the service of House Stark at Winterfell. He delivered all of Catelyn Stark's children. He is a small grey man with grey eyes and hair. He typically wears a robe of grey wool with voluminous sleeves. In the sleeves were sewn pockets, from which Maester Luwin was always drawing things.

His maester's collar is a simple choke and he is one of the few maesters who bothered to study for the Valyrian steel link.
