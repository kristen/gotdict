House Uller of Hellholt is one of the great noble houses in Dorne. The Ullers have their keep in the middle of the Dornish desert, and are reputed to be impulsive and unpredictable. There's a saying in Dorne that goes "Half of the Ullers are half-mad, and the other half are worse.

Their arms are a rayonne yellow over crimson. The Hellholt has been named after an event in which unwelcome visitors to the castle were locked up and burned to death. The motto of the house does not appear in the books.

The known members of this house are:

Lord Harmen Uller, Lord of Hellholt

Ellaria Sand, his bastard daughter. Paramour to Prince Oberyn Martell

Ser Ulwyck Uller: His brother.
