Nute, better known as Nute the Barber, is an ironborn raider and a member of Lord Victarion Greyjoy's crew aboard the Iron Victory.

He is a thickset man with bandy legs and long arms. His eyes are growing weak. He earned his nickname "the Barber" due to his ability in his youth to throw an axe so well that it was said he could shave you with it.
