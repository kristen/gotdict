Naath is an island of the northwestern coast of the continent of Sothoryos. The people are called Naathi. They are called the Peaceful People they make music rather than war and kill nothing, not even animals, eating only fruit and never flesh. They are widely sought after by slavers who consider them to make the best slaves.

They have a unique look to them with flat faces, dark skin and golden eyes.

The Naath believe in one god, the Lord of Harmony, who has existed and will exist for all time. He is the source of creation.
