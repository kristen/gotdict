Ser Clarence Crabb is a legendary hero from the Crackclaw Point area.

According to legend he was eight feet tall and strong enough to uproot trees and throw them half a mile. He was so heavy that only an aurochs could carry him. His seat was called the Whispers, so named due to the disembodied heads that he would collect and bring home to his wife who would raise them from the dead. The dead heads would give him counsel and talk among themselves in a whisper. Ser Clarence collected the heads from a variety of people including pirates, lords, wizards, knights and even one king from Duskendale.
