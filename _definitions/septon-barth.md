Septon Barth was the Hand of the King for Jaehaerys I. History: Barth was the son of a blacksmith. He was found by Jaehaerys I in the Red Keep's library. He was appointed the Hand of the King by Jaehaerys and sat in that position for forty years. It seems he excelled at this function, the forty years he was acting as Hand of the King are generally referred to as synonym for prosperity, much like the reign of Jaehaerys I.

He wrote an important I corpus about dragons, Dragons, Wyrms, and Wyverns: Their Unnatural History. He was considered more of a sorcerer than a Septon by his enemies. Thus his writings were burnt during the reign of Baelor I. Among his works, he claimed that dragons were neither female nor male.
