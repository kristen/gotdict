---

The Silent Sisters is a separate order of women sworn to the service of the Stranger, who have taken the vows of chastity and silence. They handle the bodies of the dead, preparing them for funerals. They are not regarded as septas. Silent Sisters are sometimes referred to as 'Wives of the Stranger'. They clothe themselves in grey and keep their faces cowled except for their eyes. Silent sisters handling the bodies of the dead, include removing bowels and organs, as well as drain blood, from corpses. They may also stuff the body with fragrant herbs and salts to preserve it and hide the smell of decomposition.
