Viserys Targaryen, called The Beggar King, is the heir of his father Aerys II and brother Rhaegar after their deaths during Robert's Rebellion. The war, however, turned him into an exile who plots to regain control of the Iron Throne. He styles himself as Viserys Targaryen, the Third of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

He has a sister, Daenerys. Viserys has the silver-blonde hair and purple eyes of House Targaryen, and a hard, gaunt face.
