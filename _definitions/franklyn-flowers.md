Ser Franklyn Flowers, also known as the Bastard of Cider Hall, is a knight in service to the Golden Company. Franklyn is a big-bellied, shambling hulk of a man with a seamed face crisscrossed with old scars. His right ear looks as if a dog had chewed on it and his left ear is missing entirely. He wears a lord's ransom in golden arm rings.

He claims that his mother was a washerwoman at Cider Hall who was raped by one of the Lord's sons. Due to this Franklyn loathes Fossoways. He has been with the Golden Company for at least a dozen years.
