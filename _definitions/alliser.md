title: Alliser
---

Ser Alliser Thorne is a master-at-arms of the Night's Watch at Castle Black. The tone of his voice and his contempt makes him hated by the Night's Watch's recruits.

He is a fifty year old man, heft, dry and hard, with eyes as black as onyx and black hairs ridged with white. Alliser is a slender man. His face is sharp-featured. His build is compact and sinewy. His voice has an edge, sharp as Valyrian steel.
