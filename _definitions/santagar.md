 House Santagar of Spottswood is a house of landed knights from Dorne.

Neither their arms or their motto appear in the books. In a semi-canon source they blazon their arms with a spotted leopard with a golden axe, over a per bend sinister blue and white field.

The known members of this house are:

Ser Symon Santagar, the Knight of Spottswood.

Sylva Santagar, called "Spotted Silva", heiress to Spottswood.
