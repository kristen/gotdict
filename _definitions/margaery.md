Margaery Tyrell is the only daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell and his wife, Lady Alerie. She is very beautiful, with softly curling brown hair, brown eyes and a slender yet shapely figure.

She is an intelligent, shrewd and political savvy young woman, very much the protege of her cunning grandmother, Lady Olenna Redwyne. She is sixteen years old.
