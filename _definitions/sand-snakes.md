The Sand Snakes are the bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell by various women the name alluding to their father's nickname, "the Red Viper", and to their surname Sand, given to bastards in Dorne. Some daughters of his were born of septas, others of noble women and others still of prostitutes. Despite the variances in their birthmothers and appearances, they are all said to have their father's eyes.

The oldest Sand Snakes are companions and confidantes of their cousin, Princess Arianne. The youngest four are Oberyn's daughters by his paramour, Ellaria Sand.
