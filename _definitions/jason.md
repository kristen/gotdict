Lord Jason Mallister is the head of House Mallister and Lord of Seagard. He has at least one son, Patrek. Ser Jason was defeated in a tourney at Storm's End by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.

As a bannerman to House Tully, he attended the wedding of Catelyn Tully to Eddard Stark where his gifts were lavish.

During Robert's Rebellion, he fought bravely at the Battle of the Trident, avenging his brother by slaying three of Prince Rhaegar's bannermen and later, during Greyjoy Rebellion, by slaying Rodrik Greyjoy beneath the walls of Seagard, throwing the ironmen reavers back into the sea. After the conclusion of the Greyjoy Rebellion, Robert I ordered a tourney to be held at Lannisport to celebrate his victory.
