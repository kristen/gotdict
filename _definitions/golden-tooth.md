title: Golden Tooth
---

 The Golden Tooth is a stronghold in the Westerlands. It is more commonly known as 'the Tooth'. It guards the one large pass through the mountains that allows direct travel between the Westerlands and the Riverlands to the west. It is generally held that in order to attack the Westerlands from the east, one must take the Golden Tooth to have a secure passage. It is the seat of House Lefford. The gold from the Golden Tooth helped establish House Lannister as one of the richest houses in Westeros.
