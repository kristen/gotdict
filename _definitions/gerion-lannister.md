Gerion Lannister was a member of House Lannister. He was the youngest and most reckless brother of Tywin Lannister, the head of the house.Tyrion and Jaime often refer to him as their favourite uncle. He prized and supported Tyrion when the dwarf recited historical facts memorized by heart or cartwheeled across the supper table in Casterly Rock's great hall. He once gifted Tyrion with the books Wonders and Wonders Made by Man by Lomas Longstrider and often had Tyrion recite the sixteen wonders of the World.

Like his brothers, Kevan and Tygett, Gerion was overshadowed by their older brother Tywin Lannister. While Kevan build up a life near Tywin and Tygett tried to be independent, Gerion mocked this "game" and made jokes. He was said to be a man quick to laugh and had a gift for making others laugh. Gerion had a natural daughter; Joy Hill.

Later Gerion went on a quest to find the ancestral sword Brightroar and any other treasures that might have survived the Doom of Valyria circa 292 AL. Almost a decade passed after his ship the Laughing Lion left Lannisport but Gerion never returned. Tywin Lannister sent men to look for his lost brother and they traced him as far as Volantis, where half his crew had deserted him because of his intent to sail into the Smoking Sea. He had to buy slaves to replace them.

What happened to him and if he is still alive is unknown, although he is most likely dead as few survive a journey to the ruins of Valyria.
