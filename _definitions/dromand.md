title: Dromand

The dromon was a type of galley and the most important warship of the Byzantine navy from the 5th to 12th centuries AD, when they were succeeded by Italian-style galleys. It was developed from the ancient liburnian, which was the mainstay of the Roman navy during the Empire.

Middle English dromond and Old French dromont are derived from the dromon, and described any particularly large medieval ship.
