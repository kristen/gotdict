title: Dagger Lake
---

Dagger Lake is a large lake that is formed by the confluence of the rivers Rhoyne and Qhoyne. At Dagger Lake the Qhoyne comes rushing in, the Darkling Daughter, full of gold and amber from the Axe and pinecones from the Forest of Qohor. To the northeast is Ar Noy and along its western banks, the Golden Fields.

Dagger Lake is full of islands where pirates lurk in hidden caves and secret strongholds, such as Urho the Unwashed and Korra the Cruel on Hag's Teeth.
