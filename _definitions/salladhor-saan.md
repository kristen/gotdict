title: Salladhor Saan
---

Lord Salladhor Saan is a Lysene pirate and sellsail and is good friends with Ser Davos Seaworth. He is a smuggler, trader, banker and a notorious pirate. He has no wives, only concubines. He styles himself as the Prince of the Narrow Sea. He is a sleek, smiling man whose flamboyance is a byword on both sides of the Narrow Sea.

When Davos met with him in the inn on Dragonstone Salladhor was wearing flashing cloth-of-silver, with dagged sleeves so long the ends of them pooled on the floor. His buttons were carved jade monkeys and atop his wispy white curls was perched a jaunty green cap decorated with a fan of peacock feathers.
