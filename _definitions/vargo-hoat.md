title: Vargo Hoat
---

Vargo Hoat is the leader of the Brave Companions, a particularly unsavory sellsword company referred to as the "Bloody Mummers" in the Seven Kingdoms. The Mummers are described as the scum of the world, criminals and outcasts from many countries, with Hoat himself originating in Qohor. He is sometimes called "the Goat" due to his helm which is shaped to appear like goat horns.

Vargo is a tall, gaunt man with a long goatee and a necklace of coins from all the places where he has fought. He rides a zorse. His coat of arms feature the Black Goat of Qohor and he wears a helm shaped as a goat's head. A perpetually swollen tongue causes him to lisp and slobber when he speaks. Despite this Hoat is more cunning then he seems as no man survives being the commander of the Brave Companions without being ruthless and shrewd. He is a sadist who frequently tortures his prisoners by chopping off their hands and feet, earning him the additional nickname "the Crippler".
