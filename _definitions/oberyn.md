Prince Oberyn Nymeros Martell, known as the Red Viper, is Doran's hot-headed younger brother. He has eight bastard daughters, called the Sand Snakes, the four youngest of which by his current paramour Ellaria Sand.

Some rumors hold that he is bisexual. His squire (and one of his many rumored lovers) is Daemon Sand. Oberyn is a forceful, lusty man with a quick wit and barbed tongue.

He studied at the Citadel for a while, and apparently forged several maester links but eventually grew bored and left the order. Oberyn had traveled the world, and even founded his own mercenary company.

He had a very close relationship with his sister Elia and they were inseparable as children. Oberyn has a lined face with thin eyebrows, black "viper" eyes and a sharp nose. His hair is lustrous and black with only a few silver streaks and recedes from his brow into a widow's peak.
