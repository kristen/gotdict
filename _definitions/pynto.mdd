title: Pynto
---

Pynto is the innkeep of a tavern in Braavos. Pynto never changes his clothes or washes his hair. He is loud and smelly but he also has a soft heart under all his unwashed clothes and bluster. To hear him tell it in his younger days Pynto had been the most notorious pirate on the Stepstones, he loves nothing better than to speak at great length about his exploits. Pynto's tavern is full of cats - the old pirate believes that they bring good luck and keep his tavern free of vermin.
