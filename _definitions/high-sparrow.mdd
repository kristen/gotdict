title: High Sparrow
---

The High Sparrow is the current High Septon of the Faith of the Seven. His real name is unknown. He is a tall, thin, hard-eyed, grey-haired man with a heavily lined face.

Unlike previous High Septons, he does not wear rich robes or elaborate crowns of crystal and spun gold. Instead, he wears a simple white wool tunic that goes to his ankles. The man is truly devout to his faith and has an iron will.
