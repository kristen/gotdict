Lysono Maar is a sellsword from Lys in service to the Golden Company. He is the company's spymaster. He is Lyseni. He has lilac eyes and white gold hair and lips that would have been the envy of a whore. At first glance Jon Connington almost takes him for a woman. His fingernails are painted purple, and his earlobes drip with pearls and amethysts.
