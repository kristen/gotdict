title: Benerro

Benerro is the high priest of R'hllor at the Red Temple in the free city of Volantis. Benerro is tall and thin, he has a shaven head, a drawn face and skin as white as milk. Slave tattoo's of flames cover his cheeks, chin and shaven head to make a bright red mask that crackles about his eyes and coils down and around his lipless mouth. His voice carries high and well.
