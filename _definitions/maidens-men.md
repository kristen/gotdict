title: Maiden's Men
---

The Maiden's Men are a sellsword company in the Free Cities.

After the defeat at the Battle of the Redgrass Field, those lords and knights who went into exile with Ser Aegor Rivers began to sign on to sellsword companies, such as the Maiden's Men. This would cause Ser Aegor to make his own company, the Golden Company. The Tattered Prince was once a member.
