title: Horonno
---

Horonno was one of the ruling Triarchs of the Free City of Volantis during the Century of Blood.

He was elected and reelected Triarch over forty times, until he got sick of the elections and attempted to name himself Triarch for life. This resulted in an uprising against him. He was overthrown and those who defeated him had each of his limbs tied by rope to four elephants who were made charge in four different directions, ripping Horonno to pieces. All the statues of him in Volantis have had the heads smashed off.
