The Defiance of Duskendale, which took place in 277 AC, was a landmark event during the reign of King Aerys II Targaryen. The Defiance began when the Lord of Duskendale refused to pay taxes, demanding a new town charter and certain rights for citizens and ended with the extirpation of one noble family and a severe rift between the King and his Hand of the King, Lord Tywin Lannister.
