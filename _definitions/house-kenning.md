House Kenning of Harlaw is a noble house from the Iron Islands. The Kennings were once bitter foes of House Harlaw, but were defeated and are now their vassals. They blazon their shields with the Storm God's cloudly hand, pale grey, yellow lightning flashing from the fingertips, on black.

It is unknown if there is a blood relation between the Harlaw Kennings and the Kennings of Kayce.

The known members of House Kenning are:

Ralf Kenning : an ironborn captain.
