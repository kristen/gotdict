House Blackwood of Raventree Hall is an old house from the Riverlands, sworn to House Tully. They blazon their arms with a flock of ravens on scarlet surrounding a dead weirwood upon a black escutcheon.

Blackwoods are an old house in the riverlands, descended of the First Men. They had been petty kings during the Age of Heroes. They lost this status when the Andals came, but still managed to keep many of their cultural legacies including the religion of the Old Gods, being one of the few houses south of the Neck to do so.

They have an old bitter feud against their neighbors the Brackens, coming from the Age of Heroes when both houses ruled as kings. The feud has continued throughout the years, aided by House Bracken's conversion to the Faith of the Seven. The Teats, Battle Valley, and the village of Blackbuckle are part of the disputed land. The feud had abated until Ser Otho Bracken, the Brute of Bracken, slew Lord Quentyn Blackwood in a tournament at King's Landing about a century ago. So when Lord Bracken named his son Otho as heir on his deathbed, the Blackwoods were enraged and rekindled the hostilities that carry on to the present day.

Presently, Lord Tytos Blackwood is lord of Raventree Hall, his son and heir is Lucas Blackwood.
