title: Golden Storm

The Golden Storm was a longship captained by Aeron Greyjoy during the Greyjoy Rebellion. It was sunk during the Battle of Fair Isle.

The Golden Storm was Aeron's newly made longship. Aeron who in his early years was jolly drunk, claimed the Drowned God gifted him with the ability to piss longer or farther than any man. Upon receiving his longship, he wagered it against a herd of goats that he would be able to put out a hearthfire by pissing on it. He won the bet giving the ship its name the Golden Storm, though Balon threatened to hang him from her mast when he heard what sort of ram his brother intended to mount upon her prow to serve as graphic monument to his accomplishment.

During the Greyjoy Rebellion he sailed with Victarion against Stannis and it was sunk by the great warship Fury at the Battle of Fair Isle.
