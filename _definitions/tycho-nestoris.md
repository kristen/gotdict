Tycho Nestoris is a representative of the Iron Bank of Braavos sent to to negotiate payment of the debt of the Iron Throne. Tycho Nestoris is a tall gaunt stick of a man with long legs and a beard as thin as a rope from his chin and almost reaching his waist. He had a narrow face. He wears a brimless three-tiered hat of purple felt, robes of a sober purple trimmed with ermine and a high stiff collar.
