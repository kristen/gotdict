Elia Sand is the oldest bastard daughter of Prince Oberyn Martell and his paramour Ellaria Sand. She is one of the famous 'Sand Snakes'. She's fond of horses and jousting, her weapon of choice is the lance. She wears her hair in a black braid and had her father's eyes. She often smelled like a horse to her mother's despair.
