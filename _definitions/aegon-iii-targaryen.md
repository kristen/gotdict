title: Aegon III Targaryen
---

Aegon III Targaryen, also known as Aegon the Dragonbane was the seventh king of the Targaryen line. He succeeded his uncle, Aegon II, at the conclusion of the Dance of the Dragons. With Aegon II leaving no male heirs, the ascension of Aegon III is a possible dynastic vindication of his mother's claim to the throne.
