Wendel Frey is the (supposedly) nineteenth Son of Lord Walder Frey and the first son born of Lord Walder Frey marriage to Annara Farring. He is thirteen years old. He is a page at Seagard. However rumor in the Twins is that Annara Farring was sleeping with Black Walder Frey making Wendels parentage dubious.
