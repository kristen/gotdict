title: Lyanna Stark
---

Lyanna Stark was the younger sister of Lord Eddard Stark and was betrothed to Ned's childhood friend Robert Baratheon. Her abduction by Rhaegar Targaryen was the event that ultimately triggered Robert's Rebellion and led to the downfall of the Targaryen Dynasty. Lyanna is described by all who knew her as beautiful, with the dark hair, grey eyes and long face that characterize the Starks. She is referred to as "wolf-blooded", headstrong, willful, courageous and hot-tempered.

Arya Stark is often compared to her in both appearance and personality.

She is noted to have been an extremely skilled rider. Lyanna was very fond of the blue winter roses that grew at Winterfell.
