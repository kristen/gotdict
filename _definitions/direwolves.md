title: Direwolves
---

A direwolf is a close relative of the wolf, but larger and stronger. A grey direwolf in a white field is the banner of House Stark. Direwolves can grow as large as ponies. In proportion to their bodies, their legs are longer and their heads are larger than normal wolves. Their muzzles are also longer and more pronounced. Possible colorations include grey with yellow eyes and black with green eyes. Albino direwolves have white fur and red eyes.
