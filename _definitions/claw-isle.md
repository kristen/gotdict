Claw Isle is the ancient island seat of House Celtigar. It lies a few hours sail from Dragonstone.

Though Lord Celtigar has shown the world a niggardly face, he has never stinted on his own comforts. Claw Isle's castle is reputedly stuffed with Myrish carpets, Volantene glass, gold and silver plate, jeweled cups, magnificent hawks, an axe of Valyrian steel, a horn that can summon monsters from the deep, chests of rubies, and more wines that a man could drink in a 100 years.
