House Vikary is a house of landed knights sworn to Casterly Rock. Their arms are quarterly: a red boar's head on white, beneath a gold bend sinister a silver lion rampant regardant with a forked tail, armed and langued gold, on red. The reversing in the second and third quarters of the red and silver of the Reyne arms beneath a bend sinister may indicate that the founder of the house was either a Reyne bastard or a descendant of a Reyne bastard.

The known members of this house are:

Ser Lymond Vikary, head of house Vikary.
