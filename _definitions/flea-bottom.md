title: Flea Bottom
---

Flea Bottom is what the slum area of King's Landing is called. A down-trodden area of town. It has pot-shops along the alleys where one can get a 'bowl o' brown.' It has a stench of pigsties and stables, tanner's sheds mixed in the smell of winesinks and whorehouses. It is a maze twisty unpaved alleys and cross street below the Street of Flour on the way down the west side of Rhaenys's Hill. The buildings lean over the narrow allyes, they almost touch.
