Galazza Galare is the Ghiscari high priestess of Meereen. She is known as the Green Grace. Galazza is in her eighties.

Her hair is white and her skin parchment-thin, but the years have not dimmed her eyes. They are a piercing green, matching the color of her robes as a Green Grace. She typically wears green robes and a veil. When wearing the veil, most of her face is hidden from prying eyes. Only her eyes remain visible. Her voice sounds soft and kind.
