title: Stannis
---

Stannis Baratheon is the elder of Robert Baratheon's younger brothers. He served on his brother's small council as Master of Ships and was also Lord of Dragonstone.

Like his brothers, Stannis is a large man - tall, broad shouldered and sinewy. While he is not described as being particularly unattractive he is also not considered as handsome as his brother Renly or his brother Robert as he was in his youth. He has dark blue eyes. His head has only a fringe of black hair "like the shadow of a crown," and a close-cropped beard across his large jaw. His face has a tightness to it like cured leather, and he has hollow cheeks. He has thin, pale lips. He is a serious, stubborn, unforgiving man with an inflexible sense of duty and justice. He neither dissembles nor flatters.

Stannis is obsessed with slights both real and imagined and grinds his teeth regularly. He is an accomplished commander, sailor, and warrior, although his personality gets in his way to being a great leader as well. While he is respected and feared he has never been loved or had the affection of nobles or smallfolk. Stannis has a cold relationship with his wife, Lady Selyse of House Florent, and they have one daughter, Shireen, a sad little girl bearing a disfigurement from an ailment. Davos Seaworth is one of Stannis's most loyal servants.
