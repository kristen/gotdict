Ser Mandon Moore is a knight of the Kingsguard. Jaime Lannister considered him the most dangerous of the Kingsguard after himself because his face gave nothing away. He has pale grey eyes, flat and lifeless.

He was brought to King's Landing by Lord Jon Arryn and Robert Baratheon gave him a white cloak. He is a skilled warrior but not loved by the smallfolk despite his prowess, nor is he close to any of his fellow Kingsguard.
