Qhorin, known as Halfhand, is a ranger of the Night's Watch and second-in-command at the Shadow Tower. Qhorin Halfhand is tall and clean-shaven with gray eyes.

He wears his grey hair in a long braid. Qhorin is a living legend in the Watch. He is considered to be one of the best rangers within the Watch.

He is called Halfhand because he lost all the fingers on his right hand except his thumb and forefinger to a wildling axe. Because of this, he was forced to train himself how to fight left-handed and became just as proficient with his left hand as he had been with his right.
