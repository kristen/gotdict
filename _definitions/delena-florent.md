Delena Florent is the mother of Edric Storm and niece to Lord Alester Florent. She is married to Ser Hosman Norcross and has two children by him.

During the wedding of Lord Stannis Baratheon and Lady Selyse Florent, King Robert Baratheon carried Delena, who was one of Selyse's bedmaids, upstairs to the bedroom of Lord Stannis and Lady Selyse and broke in the wedding bed. This coupling eventually led to the birth of Edric Storm. Since he was of noble blood on both sides, he was acknowledged by the king as his bastard.
