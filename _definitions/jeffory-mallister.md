title: Jeffory Mallister

Jeffory Mallister was a member of House Mallister.

When news of Lyanna Stark's kidnapping by Rhaegar Targaryen reached her brother, Brandon Stark, he raced off to King's Landing accompanied by his party, which included Jeffory. Brandon and his party rode into the Red Keep demanding Rhaegar's head. Aerys II had them all arrested and demanded that their fathers come to King's Landing to answer for their sons crimes. Aerys had all of them killed save for Ethan Glover. He was likely the brother of Lord Jason Mallister, though this is never confirmed.
