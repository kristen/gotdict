Ser Richard Horpe is a member of House Horpe and a Queen's Man. Ser Richard is Lean, dark-haired, hard-eyed, his face marred by pockmarks and old scars. As a squire he dreamed of a white cloak, but Cersei Lannister spoke against him and Robert Baratheon passed him over. He is said to lust for battle. Stannis refers to him as "The Slayer".
