The Children of the Forest, sometimes referred to simply as the "children" are a mysterious non-human race that originally inhabited Westeros continent, long before the arrival of the First Men during the Dawn Age, more than 12,000 years ago. The giants call them woh dak nag gram ('little squirrel people'). They call themselves in the True Tongue those who sing the song of the earth.
