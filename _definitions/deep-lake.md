title: Deep Lake
---

Deep Lake is a castle along the Wall, abandoned by the Night's Watch. The castle sits next to a green lake seven miles east of the Nightfort. It was first built during the reign of Jaehaerys I as a smaller, cheaper replacement for the Nightfort. Queen Alysanne Targaryen convinced the Night's Watch to replace the older castle. Deep Lake was paid for by Queen Alysanne and built by the men that her husband Jaehaerys I, sent north. To the east of Deep Lake sits Queensgate.
