title: Bran the Builder
---

Brandon Stark, also known as Brandon the Builder, was a member of House Stark (and perhaps even its founder) who lived during the Age of Heroes. He owes his name to the fact he built the Wall and Winterfell.

Some stories say he did it with the help of Giants. He is accredited for other famous constructions, especially Storm's End. It's said that Bran the Builder had given the Night's Watch Brandon's Gift, a stretch of land 25 leagues wide, but Maesters argue it was some other Brandon of House Stark
