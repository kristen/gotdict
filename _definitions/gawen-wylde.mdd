Ser Gawen Wylde was a member of House Wylde. He was the former master-at-arms at Storm's End.

During Robert's Rebellion, when the Siege of Storm's End was at its worst, Ser Gawen and three other knights tried to sneak out of Storm's End through a postern gate and surrender. They were intercepted and captured. Stannis Baratheon, commanding the castle ordered them flung from the walls using the catapults. As they were being strapped down, Maester Cressen suggested that they not send them to their deaths, as the remaining rations were low and there was no need to waste good meat. He was sent to the cells where he later died.
