Visenya Targaryen was the older of Aegon I's sisters. During the War of Conquest, she rode the dragon, Vhagar, to battle. A passionate, temperamental woman, she was apt to dress as a warrior, with her hair in braided coils or bound in rings, and wielded the Valyrian steel sword Dark Sister. Aegon's eldest sister was a warrior more comfortable in ringmail than in silk. She was described as having a harsh beauty and was reputed to have dabbled in sorcery.
