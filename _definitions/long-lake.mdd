title: Long Lake
---

Long Lake is a large lake in the North. It is located to the north-east of Winterfell and west of the Lonely Hills. The Kingsroad runs along its north western shore on its way to the Wall. It is longer than it is wide and the source of the White Knife River, which flows south into the Bite bay.

In 184 AL, the lake was the site of a battle that saw Stark-Umber forces repel Raymun Redbeard, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, who managed to bypass the wall. Its the place of burial of the dead of that battle.
