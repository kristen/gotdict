Roro Uhoris was a Tyroshi smuggler and pirate, captain of the Cobblecat. He was known as the Blind Bastard up and down the narrow sea though he was neither blind nor a bastard. He claimed that he could tell one port from another just by the way they smelled. Cities were like women, he insisted; each one had its own unique scent. Oldtown was as flowery as a perfumed dowager. Lannisport was a milkmaid, fresh and earthy, with woodsmoke in her hair. King's Landing reeked like some unwashed whore. White Harbor was shape, salty, and a little fishy like a mermaid should. He said the more seals on Seal Rock the luckier the voyage would be.
