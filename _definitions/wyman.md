Lord Wyman Manderly, known as Lord Too-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse, of White Harbor is the head of House Manderly. He has two sons, Ser Wylis and Ser Wendel and has been a widower for eight years.

He is so fat he can no longer ride a horse and must be carried in a litter. He is nearly sixty years old. He has a loud, booming laugh. He is mocked by his own people as Lord Lamprey.
