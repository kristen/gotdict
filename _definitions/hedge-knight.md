title: Hedge Knight
---

A hedge knight is a wandering knight without a master, many are quite poor. Hedge knights travel the length and breadth of Westeros looking for gainful employment.

Hedge knights are so named because most of their worldly wealth is in their arms and horses and they generally must sleep outdoors, under a hedge.

Most hedge knights travel in search of employment and often attend jousts to make money and display their prowess in hopes of being hired and making a name for themselves.
