title: Arianne Martell
---

Arianne Martell is the eldest daughter of the ruling Prince of Dorne, Prince Doran of House Martell, and his consort, Mellario of Norvos. According to Dornish Customs, she is the Heiress of Sunspear, and the future ruling Princess of Dorne. Arianne is buxom and beautiful, with olive skin, large dark eyes, and long black hair that falls in ringlets to the middle of her back. Favoring her mother, she is short, standing at five foot two.

When attending to matters of politics, she conceals her lush and curvaceous body with flowing silks, jewels, and other ostentatious displays of wealth. Arianne is calculating, adventurous and fierce-tempered. When she sees something she desires, she strives to obtain it at all costs. Despite her beauty and perhaps because of her high station, Arianne is still unmarried at the age of 23. Arianne has a clique of courtiers and confidants who accompany her, including Sylva Santagar, Drey Dalt, and Garin of the Orphans. She is also extremely close to her cousins, the Sand Snakes, especially Tyene Sand.
