title: Areo

Areo Hotah is the captain of Doran Martell's guards. He is originally from the Free City of Norvos, where he was trained by the Bearded Priests of Norvos. Areo is broad-shouldered with white hair. He bears a longaxe that has a shaft six feet long. Areo was the youngest of six children and was sold to the bearded priests at a young age. At age 16, he completed his training. He was wedded to his axe and branded on his chest to signify the event. He came to Dorne with Mellario of Norvos when she married Doran, thus entering his service.

When he first arrived in Dorne he found Dornish woman lewd, Dornish wine sour, and Dornish food full of queer hot spices. And the Dornish sun hotter than the pale, wan sun of Norvos. Hotah watched all of Doran's and Mellario's children grow up, and has developed a father-like love for princess Arianne Martell, whom he refers to as "little princess." Despite this affection, however, Hotah is utterly loyal to Prince Doran, and whenever Hotah has personal misgivings about the orders he receives, he reminds himself of his simple vow, "Serve, Obey, Protect."
