title: Asha Greyjoy
---

Asha Greyjoy is the daughter of Balon Greyjoy and his wife, Alannys. She is fierce and proud, and defies traditional ironborn gender roles by commanding her own ship, the Black Wind, and leading men into battle. Asha is lean and long-legged, with short black hair and a sharp nose in a thin face. sha was fairly unattractive in her youth. After Theon's departure for Winterfell to be Eddard Stark's hostage and ward, Asha became Balon's only remaining child in Pyke. Asha grew into an attractive and bold young woman, and Balon effectively raised her as his heir. She lost her virtue at age 16 to a sailor from Lys.
