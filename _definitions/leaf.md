Leaf is one of the Children of the Forest in service to Last Greenseer. She is the only one of the Children of the Forest who speaks Common Tongue of Westeros.

She is one of the Children of the Forest. She has nut-brown skin that is dappled like a deer's with paler spots, and large ears. She wears a cloak of leaves. She has large liquid gold and green eyes which are slitted like a cat's eyes (that is, with vertical rather than round pupils). Her hair is a tangle of brown, red and gold, autumn colours, with vines and twigs and withered flowers woven through it.
