title: Quenton Hightower

Lord Quenton Hightower was a former Lord of the High Tower, Voice of Oldtown and Lord of the Port. When the grey plague hit Oldtown, Lord Quenton had the gates closed and burned every ship in the port and ordered that anyone trying to flee was to be killed. Once the plague burned itself out, Lord Quenton rescinded those orders. The very day he did, he and his young son were pulled from their horses by the survivors and had their throats slit.
