title: Nagga's Hill
---

Nagga's Hill is located on the island of Old Wyk in the Iron Islands. It is the site of the Grey King's Hall, where in past times, the Ironborn chose their kings in a kingsmoot. It is on a hill overlooking Nagga's Cradle. The ribs of Nagga, a dead sea dragon, rise from the ground like large white trees as wide as a dromond's mast and twice as tall.
