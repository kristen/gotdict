title: Dreadfort
---

The Dreadfort is a fortress, the seat of House Bolton. It is located on the banks of the Weeping Water, in the eastern half of the continent.

The Dreadfort is ill-omened, for it is said that the Boltons still keep torture chambers and a special room where they hang the flayed skins of their enemies, including several Kings of House Stark before they were defeated by them and became their vassals. Centuries ago, the Boltons rose up against King Harlon Stark, and the Dreadfort held out for two years under siege before the Boltons surrendered.
