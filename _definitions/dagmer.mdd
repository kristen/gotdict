Dagmer, better known as Dagmer Cleftjaw, is the ironborn captain of the longship Foamdrinker. Dagmer has snow white hair and a hideous scar. A longaxe blow had nearly killed him as a child, splintering his jaw, smashing his front teeth and left him four lips instead of two. He wears a shaggy beard, but the hair does not grow where the scar is.
