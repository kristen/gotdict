Raventree Hall is the seat of House Blackwood. It is located in Blackwood Vale in the Riverlands.

The castle has ancient stone walls with moss climbing up them. There were two huge, square towers flanking the gate and a square tower at each angle in the wall. Inside the walls there is a muddy outer ward, a cavernous timber keep and a godswood. In the godswood there is a dead ancient weirwood of colossal size. Every evening at dusk hundreds of ravens come and roost all night on the dead weirwood as they have for thousands of years. It is claimed to have been poisoned by the Brackens.
