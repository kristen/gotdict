 House Grimm of Greyshield rules over one of the Shield Islands called Greyshield. The Shield Islands are a considerable sea strength and were the first line of defense during the days that the ironborn pirates tried to sail up the Mander to sack the wealth of the Reach. They blazon their shield as an iron escutcheon with silver studs on a grey-green field strewn with longships proper.

The known members of this house are:

Lord Guthor Grimm, Lord of Greyshield.
