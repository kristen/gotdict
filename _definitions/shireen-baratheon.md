title: Shireen Baratheon
---

Shireen Baratheon is the daughter of Stannis Baratheon and his only child. Her mother is Lady Selyse Florent. Shireen is regarded as a sweet child.

She is not not very pretty; she has blue eyes but inherited both her father's square, jutting jaw and her mother's large ears. The greyscale caused half of her left cheek and most of her neck to be covered in gray and black dead skin. She is nine years old.
