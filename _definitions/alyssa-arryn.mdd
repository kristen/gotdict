Alyssa Arryn is a half-legendary figure of House Arryn. She gives her name to Alyssa's Tears in the Vale. She lived six thousand years ago. Her husband, her brothers and her children were killed in front of her and she did not shed a tear. As a consequence, after her death the gods condemned her to cry until her tears overflow the Vale of Arryn. Thus were born Alyssa's Tears, a torrent which waters dive at the height of the Eyrie without ever reaching the ground of the Vale, the height and winds dispersing them during their never-ending fall.
