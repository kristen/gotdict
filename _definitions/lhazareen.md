title: Lhazareen

The Lhazareen, a race of peaceful shepherds from the continent of Essos.

Established on Lhazar, south-east of Vaes Dothrak, their camps are frequently raided for slaves by the Dothraki, who refer to them as haesh rakhi or Lamb Men. Mirroring the importance of shepherding in Lhazareen culture, their deity is known as the Great Shepherd.

They have copper skin and almond-shaped eyes, similar to the Dothraki, however they are more squat and flat-faced, their black hair cropped short. They herd sheep and farm. Their language has a sing-song quality. The Dothraki believe they lay with sheep.
