---

The Merry Midwife is an old cog. Her figurehead showed a laughing woman holding an infant by one foot. The the woman's cheeks and babe's bottom were pocked with wormholes. Her hull was covered with layers of drab grey paint. The sails were grey and tattered. Her captain is Casso Mogat. She sails from Sisterton to White Harbor.
