Merrett Frey is a member of House Frey. He is 37 years old and is the ninth son of Lord Walder Frey. He is the fourth son born of Lord Walder's marriage to Amarei Crakehall. Merrett was a big, broad man.

In his youth he had been almost as robust as his older brother Hosteen Frey, the strongest son of Lord Walder, but in later years he became "soft and fleshy."
