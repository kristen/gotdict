Is a pirate ship from Lys that with the Elephant was driven North by a storm. They found themselves at Hardhome where they saw a thousand wildlings who wanted to be taken away. They agreed to take the women and children but as soon as they were far enough away they put them below and tied them up, meaning to sell them as slaves.

Another storm damages the ship and drives it to Braavos where the Sealord seized the ship as slaving was forbidden in Bravos.
