Qarth is most famous for its warlocks, known as the Undying of Qarth, who are feared and respected throughout the East. Like the Alchemists' Guild of the Seven Kingdoms, however, the warlocks' power and prestige have waned over the years. Most warlocks have blue lips. They drink shade-of-the-evening, which makes their lips turn blue. The warlocks stronghold and seat of power is the House of the Undying, which house the Undying Ones, the most mysterious and likely the most ancient and powerful of all warlocks.
