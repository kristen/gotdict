Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a merchant prince of Qarth. He is a member of the Thirteen, a prominent group of traders within Qarth.

He is a languid, elegant man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose which is crusted with rubies, opals, and flakes of jade giving him the aspect of some strange glittery bird. His fingers are long and elegant. He can cry a single perfect tear.
