Eddison Tollet, better known as Dolorous Edd, is a member of the Night's Watch and steward of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. Eddison is very thin. He is dour, and grey-haired. History: Dolorous Edd appears to have been born to a lesser branch of the House Tollet, as he speaks of being raised in a crude house such as the poorer of the smallfolk might have. He was recruited to the Night's Watch by Yoren.
