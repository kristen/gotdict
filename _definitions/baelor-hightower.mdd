Ser Baelor Hightower, also known as Baelor Brightsmile, is the eldest son and heir of Lord Leyton Hightower. He is handsome. Prince Oberyn Martell and Princess Elia Martell visited Oldtown on their way to Casterly Rock where their mother was to broker their marriage to the Lannister twins. While there they met Baelor, who Prince Oberyn considered Elia's best suitor. Even though he liked Baelor more than the others, he called him 'Baelor Breakwind' after he farted in their presence and Elia could no longer look at him without laughing.
