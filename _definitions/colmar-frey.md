Colmar Frey is the (supposedly) twentieth son of Lord Walder Frey and the second son born of Lord Walder Frey marriage to Annara Farring. He is thirteen years old. He is promised to the Faith. However rumor in the Twins is that Annara Farring was sleeping with Black Walder Frey making Colmar's parentage dubious.
