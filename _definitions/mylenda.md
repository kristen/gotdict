Mylenda Caron is the wife of Petyr Frey. They have one child, Perra Frey. She married Petyr when he was ten and she was three times his age. It is unclear how she is related to the other members of House Caron. It seems likely that she is a sister of Lord Bryen Caron as Lord Caron's daughters all perished of an illness in the year 289.
