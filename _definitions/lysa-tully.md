Lysa Tully is a member of House Tully. She is the daughter of Hoster Tully and Minisa Whent and wife of Jon Arryn. Since her husband's death she is the Lady Regent of the Vale of Arryn. She has a son Robert Arryn.

Lysa is thick of body, pale and puffy of face. She has the blue eyes of the Tullys and a small, petulant mouth. She has long, thick, auburn hair.

In her youth at Riverrun, Lysa was a slender, shy, and delicately sweet girl who wanted nothing more than to marry the man of her dreams.

She idolized her older sister Catelyn for her betrothal to the heir of Winterfell, Brandon Stark, and hoped to one day marry a man as noble and handsome as the young Stark heir.
