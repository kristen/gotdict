title: Horn Hill

Horn Hill is the seat of House Tarly in the Reach. There is a pond that lies below the castle. It lies a hundred leagues northeast of Oldtown among the thickly-wooded foothills of the Red Mountains of Dorne. Given the Tarly sigil and Lord Randyll's threats to kill Sam while hunting, it may be gainsaid that the woods around Horn Hill are teeming with game.
