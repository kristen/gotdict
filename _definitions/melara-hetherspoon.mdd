---

Melara Hetherspoon is a member of House Hetherspoon. She was a childhood friend of Cersei Lannister and Cersei describes Melara as a girl older than Jeyne Farman.

She is contrasted to the "fat" Jeyne, implying she was slender or outright skinny. Melara was pretty, though she had freckles. The girl was "healthy as a little horse". Cersei thinks of her as bold, certainly bolder than Jeyne and possibly bolder than Cersei herself.
