title: Craster
---

Craster is a wildling, master of Craster's Keep, located beyond the Wall. Despite his unsavory reputation, he is regarded as friend to the Night's Watch. Once a powerful-looking man, he is nearing the end of his life. His hair is grey turning to white. He has a flat nose and a drooping mouth, which gives him a cruel look and one of his ears is missing, which he has lost to the cold.

Craster is one of the few wildlings not openly hostile to the Night's Watch. Although he showed the Watch no malice and offered sanctuary to those north of the Wall on rangings, he is regarded as a tenuous ally at best.
