title: Elder Brother

The Elder Brother is the leader of the Refuge on the Quiet Isle. He is tall. He is forty-four years old. He is claimed to have powers as a healer.

He has a large, square head, shrewd eyes, a veined, red nose, and a heavy jaw. He shaves his head.

The Elder Brother was once a knight. His father and his family had all been knights. He was the third son of a knight and had nothing to offer the woman he wanted to marry but the shield, sword and horse of his knighthood. He fought for House Targaryen at the Battle of the Trident where he was knocked unconscious. Others thought him dead so they stripped his armor and things and dumped his body into the river. He floated downstream where he woke up naked on the Quiet Isle. He spent the next ten years in silence.
