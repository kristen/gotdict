title: Rattleshirt
---

The Lord of Bones, also mocked as "Rattleshirt" by the brothers of the Night's Watch, is a wildling leader of renown. He is called Rattleshirt due to his armor, which is made up of loosely-tied bones that clatter as he moves. He wears a broken giant's skull as his helm.

He is a small man, with a knobby chin, thin mustache and pinched cheeks. His eyebrows join over the bridge of his nose, he has a widow's peak and dark hair. He is considered sly, cruel and treacherous.
