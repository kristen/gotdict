House Manwoody of Kingsgrave is an old Dornish noble house. Its seat of Kingsgrave is placed amidst the Prince's Pass, guarding the access to Dorne. They blazon their banners with a white skull with a golden crown, over a black field. Both the arms of the house and the name of its castle refer to the fact that the founder of the house slew an old king of the Reach there.

The known members of this house are:

Lord Dagos Manwoody: Lord of Kingsgrave.

Mors Manwoody, his eldest son.

Dickon Manwoody, his second son.

Ser Myles Manwoody, his brother.
