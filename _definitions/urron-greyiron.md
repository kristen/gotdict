title: Urron Greyiron

King Urron Greyiron, better known as Urron Redhand was the first King of the Iron Islands to make the throne hereditary, five thousand years before the War of the Five Kings. History: For thousands of years, each island of the Iron Islands had a 'salt king' and a 'rock king'.

The High King of the Isles was chosen from among them in a kingsmoot. Urron put an end to that, when he descended on the kingsmoot, held at the hill of Nagga on Old Wyk and slayed all the other kings assembled for the choosing, taking the title of the High Kingship of the Isles and making it an hereditary one. Urron line ruled uncontested for 1,000 years, until the Andals swept over the Iron Islands.
