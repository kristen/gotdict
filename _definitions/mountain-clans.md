title: Mountain Clans
---

The mountain clans are a primitive culture, divided into clans of varying size and strength, who live in the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon, in the Vale. They have rejected the authority of the Eyrie and are independent from the rest of the Seven Kingdoms and its feudal society. They are divided into clans of varying size and strength, showing some cultural differences from Westeros in that some women even participate in raids.

They are a poor people with poor quality of weapons and armor, they subsist by raiding local villages, small groups of travelers and will attack even the Lord of the Eyrie if he is not properly protected. They take all the weapons and armor they can find as well as all the grain they can from raided villages, and all the women as well regardless of whether they are wedded or not.

The clansmen ride small horses that are suited to the narrow mountain paths.
