title: Vaes Dothrak
---

Vaes Dothrak is the only city of the Dothraki people. It is located beyond the vast Dothraki Sea, beneath the Mother of Mountains and near the lake, the Womb of the World. Vaes Dothrak has no walls. It sprawls languorously, baking in the warm sun, ancient, arrogant, and empty. It is large enough to hold every khalasar, if they all return at once. Dany thinks that Vaes Dothrak must be ten times as large as Pentos. The city is ruled and inhabited by slaves and the dosh khaleen, the wives of all the khals who have come before. It is forbidden to wear a blade or shed a free man's blood within the confines of the city.
