Lord Qarlton Chelsted was a former Hand of the King to Aerys II. Lord Qarlton succeeded to the Handship after the exile of Lord Jon Connington. He was present during Aerys II's systematic build up and placement of wildfire throughout King's Landing as part of the Wildfire Plot to turn the city to ashes should Lord Robert Baratheon beat Prince Rhaegar. He protested, pleaded with Aerys not to do this and eventually resigned the Handship over it . Aerys had him dipped in wildfire and burned alive.
