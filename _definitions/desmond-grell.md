Ser Desmond Grell is the master-at-arms at Riverrun. Ser Desmond has spent the better part of his life in service to House Tully. He has a large belly. Desmond was born of House Grell one of the minor houses of the riverlands. He serves as squire, Knight and eventually master-at-arms at Hoster Tully service. Catelyn Tully tells he was a squire when she was born, a knight by the time she learned to ride and the master-at arms at Riverrun before she was wed to Eddard Stark. During Catelyn's bedding on her wedding night, he apologized for every bawdy joke he made about her.
