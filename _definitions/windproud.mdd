The Windproud was a two-masted galley belonging to House Baratheon.

Lord Steffon Baratheon and his wife, Lady Cassana had taken the Windproud to the Free Cities to search for a wife for Aerys II's son. On their return trip, the ship broke up during a storm in Shipbreaker Bay. All lives were lost with the exception of Patchface, who washed up on shore, half-mad.
