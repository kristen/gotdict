Maelys Blackfyre, better known as Maelys the Monstrous, was the last of the Blackfyre pretenders to the Iron Throne. Maelys Blackfyre descended from Daemon Blackfyre. He was named 'Maelys the Monstrous' for supposedly having eaten his twin in the womb, making him a kinslayer.

Maelys had a huge upper body with a second head sprouting from his neck. Maelys was named Captain-General of the Golden Company. During the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Maelys was one of the Band of Nine, a group of merchants, sellswords and pirates who joined forces to carve kingdoms out for themselves.

After conquering the Disputed Lands, Tyrosh and the Stepstones, Maelys convinced the other members of the band to attack Westeros and aid him in retaking what he claimed was his birthright. However, the Targaryens acted swiftly and sent their own force out to the Stepstones to meet him. There, Maelys was slain by Ser Barristan Selmy, in single combat on the Stepstones, ending the Blackfyre pretensions to the Iron Throne.
