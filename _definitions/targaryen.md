House Targaryen is a noble family of Valyrian descent that escaped the Doom. They lived for centuries on the island of Dragonstone until Aegon Targaryen and his sisters rode their dragons to the conquest of the Seven Kingdoms. House Targaryen ruled as the Kings of Westeros for nearly 300 years, until ousted in the War of the Usurper. Their seats were the capitol city of King's Landing and the island castle of Dragonstone.

The known members of this house are:

Viserys, called the Beggar King , in exile.

Daenerys, sister of Viserys and one of the last known Targaryen heirs

Maester Aemon, sworn to the Night's Watch. Great-granduncle to the Mad King.
