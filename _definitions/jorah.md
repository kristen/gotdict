Ser Jorah Mormont is an exiled knight, the former head of House Mormont and lord of Bear Island. He fled Westeros to escape execution for trading in slaves and took up work as a mercenary in the Free Cities, eventually entering the service of the last Targaryens. Jorah is a large middle-aged man, swarthy and very hairy.

He is balding, but still strong and fit. Daenerys considers him not particularly handsome.
