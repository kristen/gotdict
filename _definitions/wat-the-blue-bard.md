---

The Blue Bard is a singer in service with House Tyrell. His real name is Wat. He is young. He dresses all in blue. He dyes his curly, shoulder-length hair blue in the Tyroshi fashion. Wat was the son of a chandler and was raised in the trade, however he found he had more talent for making lutes. When he was twelve years old he ran away to join a musician troupe. He had wandered half the Reach before coming to King's Landing in search of patronage.
