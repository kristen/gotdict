title: Jade Sea
---

The Jade Sea is a large body of water located in the far east of the explored world, beyond the Straits of Qarth, which separate it from the Summer Sea.

There is a traders' circle that carries sea-traders around the Jade Sea. It takes roughly two years to travel from Pentos to the Jade Sea and back in the best conditions.

Aside from merchant traders, few from Westeros visit the area and little is known about it save that cities such as Yi Ti and Asshai lie upon its far shores.

The Jade Sea is considered an exotic name evoking fable, myth and adventure to those in Westeros. Past Yi Ti, on its eastern shores somewhere, is supposed to be a legendary dreaming city of poets.
