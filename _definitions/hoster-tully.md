Hoster Tully is the head of House Tully, Lord of Riverrun, and Lord Paramount of the Trident. In his youth he was tall and broad, had blue eyes and brown-red hair. As he got older, he got portly.

He is an old man sick for the last two years and lost weight. When he was younger, Hoster was never one to stay still. He would always be traveling somewhere.
