An uprising led by Balon Greyjoy against the Iron Throne, took place in 289 AC, nine years before the beginning of A Game of Thrones. Balon tried to break away from the Seven Kingdoms to secure independence for the Iron Islands and restore their traditions of old, lost almost three hundred years before, during the War of Conquest. The rebellion was crushed and Balon was forced to surrender, cementing the hold of King Robert Baratheon on the Iron Throne.
