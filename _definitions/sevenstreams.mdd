Sevenstreams is a village in the Riverlands. It is under the jurisdiction of House Frey. If one intends to go around the Blue Fork, one must pass through Sevenstreams and Hag's Mire, which is considered full of bogs and bad roads. The Blue Fork dissolves into smaller waterways such as rills and brooks beyond Sevenstreams.
