House Mormont of Bear Island is an old, proud, and honorable house, sworn to House Stark of Winterfell. Their seat is at Bear Island, located in the Bay of Ice far to the north-west of Winterfell. Their blazon is a a black bear over a green wood and motto "Here We Stand".

House Mormont is one of the few houses to have an ancestral weapon of Valyrian steel: a bastard sword called Longclaw. However, due to Bear Island's lack of valuable resources, the Mormonts are a rather poor house. Their hall is made of huge logs, surrounded by an earthen palisade. On the gate is a carving of a woman in a bearskin with a child in one arm suckling at her breast and a battleaxe in the other. Like the other women of Bear Island, the women of House Mormont learn how to defend themselves from ironmen and wildlings.

Legend has it that King Rodrik Stark won Bear Island in a wrestling match (presumably from the ironborn king who controlled it at the time) and gave it to the Mormonts.

Lady Maege Mormont rules after her brother Jeor Mormont joined the Night's Watch and his son Ser Jorah fled with his wife Lynesse of House Hightower to the Free Cities after having been found out when he sold some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver. Lady Mormont's heir is Dacey Mormont, a tall, lanky warrior-woman.

Lady Maege Mormont, Lady of the Bear Island.

Dacey Mormont and heir, her eldest daughter.

Alysane Mormont, her daughter and heir to Bear Island.

Lyra Mormont, her daughter.
