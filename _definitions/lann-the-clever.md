Lann the Clever is the legendary hero from the Age of Heroes that founded House Lannister. Popular amongst singers and taletellers, he supposedly swindled Casterly Rock out from under the Casterlys using nothing but his wits. In another tale he stole gold from the sun to brighten his hair. A young, strong, handsome blond-haired man, Lancel is said to closely resemble his cousin, Jaime Lannister. He has green eyes and sandy hair, and is sixteen years old.
