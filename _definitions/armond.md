Lord Armond Connington, Lord of Griffin's Roost, was the head of House Connington and father of Jon Connington.

Armond Connington died a few years before the War of the Usurper. He often liked to take his son Jon up to the tallest tower of Griffin's Roost to show his son the view of there ancestral lands. When Prince Rhaegar Targaryen visited Griffin's Roost after his trip to Dorne, Lord Armond attempted to win the prince to his side in an argument with the current Lord Morrigen.
