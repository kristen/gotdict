The Brotherhood Without Banners, also known as the Knights of Hollow Hill and the Forgotten Fellowship, is a outlaw group who fights Lannister rule in the name of former King Robert. The group was founded by the soldiers and nobles who were sent by the then Hand of the King Eddard Stark to bring Gregor Clegane to justice. After they were ambushed while crossing a ford and nearly defeated, the group continued the fight as guerrilla group. Their number increased as they were joined by defeated soldiers from other battles and refugees from the fighting.
