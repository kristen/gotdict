Hammerhorn is the seat of the main line of House Goodbrother. It lies in the Hardstone Hills on Great Wyk. It is a large, square castle. The stones used for its construction were quarried from the cliff behind it. Below its main entrance lie the openings to the mines and caves that the smallfolk in service to House Goodbrother toil in.
