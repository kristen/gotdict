title: Brandon Stark (Brother)
---

Brandon Stark, older brother to Eddard Stark, Lyanna Stark and Benjen Stark, was the original heir to Winterfell prior to Robert's Rebellion. Brandon was in appearance and character very different from Eddard. He was rather hot-blooded, something his younger brother described as coming from the wolfblood. He shared this trait with his sister. Brandon was tall and handsome, and was an excellent swordsman and jouster.
