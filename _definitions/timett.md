 Timett son of Timett, also known as Timett One-Eye, is a Red Hand, a type of warleader, of the Burned Men, one of the most feared of the clans of the Mountains of the Moon.

He is a tall fierce young man with a burned eye. During the rite of manhood for his clan, Timett burned one of his eyes out of its socket with a hot knife. Because the typical sacrifice for the rite is a nipple or finger, the impressed clan elders immediately named him a Red Hand of the tribe. Timett was very young for this position, but he inspired fear even among his fellow clansmen.
