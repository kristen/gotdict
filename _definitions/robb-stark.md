Robb Stark is the eldest son of Eddard Stark and Catelyn Tully and the heir to Winterfell and the North. Robb's appearance favors his Tully side, with a stocky build, blue eyes, and thick red-brown hair. He opened the series as a boy of fourteen years. He is his father's son, with a keen sense of honor and justice.

He shares his father's devotion to honor and is frequently accompanied by his direwolf, Grey Wind, whom he always takes with him into battle.
