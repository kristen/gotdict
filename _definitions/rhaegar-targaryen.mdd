title: Rhaegar Targaryen
---

Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was the eldest son of Aerys II and, as heir-apparent, Prince of Dragonstone. Rhaegar was popular with the smallfolk during his life, but died in Robert's Rebellion, which was triggered in part by his alleged abduction of Lyanna Stark.

Rhaegar is remembered as a heroic figure to Targaryen loyalists. Rhaegar was exceedingly intelligent and excelled at anything he put his mind to; he was considered to be a talented musician and skilled knight. He was deeply affected by "the shadow of Summerhall", because he was "born in grief" and was considered melancholic at times.
