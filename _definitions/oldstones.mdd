Oldstones is the name given to the remnants of the castle that belonged to House Mudd. Its original name has long been lost and the local inhabitants gave it its new name. It sits on a hill above the Blue Fork of the Trident. Nothing but its foundations remain and a sepulcher of the ancient River King Tristifer IV Mudd. The curtain wall of Oldstones encircles the brow of the hill upon which it sits.
