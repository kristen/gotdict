title: Nymeria Sand
---

Nymeria Sand is the bastard daughter of Oberyn Martell and a noblewoman from Volantis. She is the second oldest of the infamous Sand Snakes. Nymeria is twenty-five years old, slim and slender as a willow, with straight black hair, worn in a long braid which pulls back from a widow's peak. She has dark eyes, high cheekbones, full lips and pale white skin. Nymeria has all the beauty that her elder sister lacks but is no less deadly. She usually can conceal a dozen daggers on her person and is extremely skilled with the blades.
