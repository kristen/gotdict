Cogs are a type of ship that are mostly propelled by sails, which made it difficult to sail, especially upwind, and it was hostage to breezes and currents in a way that the swift galley was not. however it could better manage rough seas and its small crew and ample storage space gave it greater freedom of movement. making it perfect for trade or equipment transport.
