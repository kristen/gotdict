The Golden Dragon was a ship owned by House Targaryen.

Maester Aemon went north to join the Night's Watch aboard this ship. He was escorted by Ser Duncan the Tall to Eastwatch-by-the-sea. Among those aboard who had been sent to the Wall by Aegon V to join the Night's Watch alongside Aemon was Brynden Rivers.
