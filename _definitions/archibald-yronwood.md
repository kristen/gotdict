Ser Archibald Yronwood is member of House Yronwood, nephew to Lord Anders Yronwood. Ser Archibald accompanies Quentyn Martell. He is six-and-a-half-feet tall, broad of shoulder, huge of belly, with legs like tree trunks, hands the size of hams, and no neck. His arms are thick enough to rival even Strong Belwas. Because of some disease in his childhood his hair had fallen and now he is bald.
