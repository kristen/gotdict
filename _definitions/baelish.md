House Baelish of the Fingers is a noble house from the Vale. The seat of House Baelish is located on the Fingers in the Vale. Their holdings lie on the smallest of the Fingers. The current lord, Petyr Baelish is only the second generation of the landed family. His grandfather had been a landless hedge knight and his father the smallest of lords.

The house began with Petyr's great-grandfather, who was born in Braavos and came to the Vale as a sellsword employed by House Corbray. His son took the head of the Titan as his sigil when he was knighted. His arms were a grey stone head with fiery eyes on a light green field.

The known members of this house are:

Petyr Baelish, called Littlefinger
