Laughing Lion is the ship on which Gerion Lannister headed on a quest to find the Lannister ancestral sword Brightroar.

Brightroar was lost by Tommen II Lannister and Gerion hoped to return it with any other treasures that might have survived the Doom. The ship left Lannisport in 292 AL and almost nothing is known about its fate afterwards.

Tywin Lannister sent men to search for the ship and his brother. The only trace they could find was in Volantis, where the crew deserted and Gerion was forced to buy slaves, since no free man would willingly sign aboard a ship sailing to the Smoking Sea. What happened afterwards is unknown. The ship with Gerion and the crew are presumed lost at sea.
