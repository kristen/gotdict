title: Arson

Arson, better known as Arson Iceaxe, was a wildling raider. He tried to cross the Wall by digging through it's base. When he was midway under the ice, he was discovered by a patrol from the Nightfort. Instead of trying to stop the wildling, they decided to wall him in alive. The legend says that by listening the ear against the Wall, one can still ear the sound of Arson's axe who digs the ice. Since this time, the Night's Watch send infrequent patrols along the base of the Wall on it's North face to look for traces of excavation.
