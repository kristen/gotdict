title: Old Wyk

Old Wyk is one of the islands that make up the Iron Islands, located in Ironman Bay and inhabited by the Ironmen, home to the noble houses Stonehouse, the House Goodbrother of Shatterstone, and the Drumm. It is west of Great Wyk on the edge of the Sunset Sea.

The Ironmen consider Old Wyk to be the holiest of all the Iron Islands. The Grey King slew a legendary sea dragon Nagga upon its shores, and it is the place where Kingsmoots would take place for thousand of years. It is on Old Wyk where the First Men found the Seastone Chair, the traditional throne of the Iron Islands.

Windy hills and cruel black mountains make up much of Old Wyk and Nagga's Hill is located on it.
