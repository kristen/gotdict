Howland Reed is the Lord of Greywater Watch and holds dominion over the crannogmen of the Neck. Reed's children are Meera, a girl of fifteen years, and Jojen, a boy of thirteen years.

He is one of Eddard Stark's closest friends and fought alongside him in many conflicts during Robert's Rebellion. He is a small man, like all crannogmen, but also "brave, strong, and smart".
