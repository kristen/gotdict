title: Patchface
---

Patchface is Stannis's court fool and jester at Dragonstone. His face is tattooed in motley, earning his name. Patchface takes his name for the tattoos covering his broad face and bald head, marked in a pattern of green and red squares. This is the fashion in the free city of Volantis for slaves and servents.

In his youth he was clever boy with astonishing wit, however after his accident his mind and body are broken. After his survival from the shipwreck he is described as soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles and has weird sideways walk.
