title: Blackhaven
---

Blackhaven is the seat of House Dondarrion. It sits at the bottom of the Boneway, as the last stop before one enters the passes of the Dornish Marches.

When Ser Barristan Selmy was ten years old, he borrowed armor and entered a tourney as a mystery knight that took place at Blackhaven, where he was eventually defeated and unmasked by Prince Duncan Targaryen. For that, Barristan earned the nickname 'Bold'.
