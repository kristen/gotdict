<p>A community built Kindle dictionary for George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series based on the work of <a href="http://keckrew.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/game-of-thrones-kindle-dictionary.html">KEC Krew</a>. While a number of characters have X-Ray entries this dictionary aims to be much more extensive having information on houses, locations, ships, maps and much more. Currently there are <strong>{{ site.definitions.size }}</strong> entries in the dictionary.</p>

<p>The dictionary aims to the spoiler safe. Plot details have been removed from entries, characters who later die have past tense verbs changed to present. As this diminishes the usefulness of the dictionary further into the series it is hoped to create dictionary builds for each book, adding additional details as the story progresses.</p>
